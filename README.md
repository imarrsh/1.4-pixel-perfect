# Surf and Paddle 
#### (1.4-pixel-perfect)
This project is from the end of week 1 at [The Iron Yard Greenville](https://theironyard.com). The goal was a deep dive into recreating a design mock-up in HTML/CSS to be as close to the original design as possible.

Since this was the introductory week to Front-End Engineering, there isnt much tooling here aside from normalize.css to help with initial styles and cross-browser rendering. I had some previous experience with layout and styling, I took the challeng of making the page responsive as well.
